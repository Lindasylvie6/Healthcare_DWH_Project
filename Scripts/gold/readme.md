## Gold Layer – Analytics & Power BI

The Gold layer transforms cleaned Silver data into business-ready datasets optimized for reporting and analytics. 
This layer follows a star schema design with fact and dimension tables, enabling efficient querying and integration with Power BI dashboards.

### Dimension Tables (Filters & Slicers)
- **dim_patient** → Patient-level filters and segmentation
- **dim_provider** → Provider filters and performance slicing
- **dim_date** → Time intelligence (YTD, MTD, trends)

### Fact Tables (Business Metrics & Dashboards)
- **fact_encounters** → Utilization dashboard (visits, admissions)
- **fact_claims** → Revenue cycle dashboard (billing, payments)
- **fact_denials** → Denial management dashboard
- **fact_clinical** → Clinical quality dashboard (labs, outcomes)
- **fact_monthly_kpis** → Executive summary dashboard
- **fact_provider_performance** → Provider scorecard

### Design Highlights
- Star schema optimized for Power BI performance
- Pre-aggregated and derived metrics for faster reporting
- Separation of dimensions (filters) and facts (measures)
- Supports interactive dashboards and business decision-making

GOLD LAYER – BUSINESS LOGIC & ANALYTICS (POWER BI READY)
=============================================================

Description:
This script creates the Gold layer of the healthcare data warehouse.
The Gold layer transforms cleaned Silver data into business-ready,
analytics-optimized tables designed for reporting and dashboards.

Purpose:
- Enable fast and efficient querying for Power BI
- Provide curated datasets for business users
- Support key healthcare analytics use cases (utilization, revenue, quality)

Design Approach:
- Star schema (fact and dimension tables)
- Dimension tables provide filtering and slicing capabilities
- Fact tables store measurable business metrics
- Pre-aggregated and derived metrics improve dashboard performance

Key Components:
- Dimensions: patient, provider, date
- Facts: encounters, claims, denials, clinical, KPIs, provider performance

Notes:
- Gold layer is optimized for analytics, not raw data storage
- Data is sourced from validated Silver tables
- Business logic and aggregations are applied here
